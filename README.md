Feeder
======

A Qt-Based Feedly RSS client using The Feedly Cloud API (developer.feedly.com)

## Note
This program is still in its early development, which means it's barely useable.

## Contribute
I'll greatly appreciate it if you could help me with it. Because I'm kind of a newbie in Qt development. And because of China's Great Firewall, Feedly is sometimes blocked, which makes debugging really miserable.
